In this paper, we propose a general system power model and explore the optimal speed setting to minimize system energy consumption for an Optimistic TMR (OTMR) scheme. The performance of OTMR is compared with that of TMR and Duplex with respect to energy and reliability. The results show that OTMR is always better than TMR by achieving higher levels of reliability and consuming less energy. With checkpoint overhead and recovery, Duplex is not applicable when system load is high. However, Duplex may be more energy efficient than OTMR depending on system static power and checkpointing overhead. Moreover, with one recovery section, Duplex achieves comparable levels of reliability as that of OTMR.},

abstract = {In the critical systems domain, Mixed Criticality Systems (MCS) improve considerably the usage of computation resources by running tasks with different levels of criticality on multi-core processors. To ensure the safety of MCS, services provided by low criticality tasks are degraded or stopped whenever high criticality tasks need more computation time than initially credited. The evaluation of this degradation is hardly considered in the literature although low criticality services are of prime importance for the quality of service (QoS) of critical systems. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the availability of low criticality services, i.e. how often these services are delivered in MCS. We also propose a task model that improves this availability, demonstrated thanks to our evaluation method on an illustrative example of MCS.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is an important issue in computing systems and operating within a safe power budget is a necessary constraint. This paper presents a simple and practical solution both for energy minimization and peak power reduction, called Single Voltage Approximation (SVA) scheme, for periodic real-time tasks on multicore systems with a shared supply voltage in a voltage island. SVA is inspired by the Single Frequency Approximation (SFA) scheme, in which all the cores in the island run at a single voltage and frequency such that all tasks can meet their deadlines. In SVA, all the cores in the island are also executed at the same single voltage as in SFA. However, the frequency of each core is individually chosen, such that the tasks in each core can meet their deadlines, but without running at unnecessarily high frequencies. Thus, all the cores are executing tasks all the time and there is no need for any Dynamic Power Management (DPM) technique for reducing the energy consumption for idling. For task partitioning, SVA is combined with the Double Largest Task First (DLTF) partitioning scheme. Most importantly, this paper provides comprehensive analysis for combining DLTF and SVA, deriving its worst-case behavior both for energy minimization and peak power reduction, compared against the optimal solutions. Our analysis shows that, depending on the hardware, the energy consumption by combining DLTF and SVA is at most 1.95 (2.21, 2.42, and 2.59, respectively), compared to the optimal solutions, when the voltage island has up to 4 (8, 16, and 32, respectively) cores, which outperforms the worst-case factors of SFA when the cores fail to sleep efficiently. For peak power reduction, due to running at slower frequencies, combining DLTF and SVA always outperforms SFA, both in average and corner cases. Finally, we extend our analysis considering multicore systems with discrete voltage and frequency pairs and multiple voltage islands.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the task scheduling for preventing the occurrence of peak power in the multi-core systems considering data dependence. In the mobile system, the peak power reduces the battery lifetime and makes the system unstable. Among the power consumption of system, the proportion of power consumption of core is very large. If cores execute multiple tasks simultaneously, this gives rise to the peak power. Therefore, algorithm to minimize the occurrence of peak power is needed. When multiple tasks are allocated to the multi-core systems, data dependence relations of all tasks should be considered to avoid data interferences. The proposed algorithm to reduce the peak power schedules the tasks with the data dependence information after data dependence analysis. The proposed algorithm is composed of task partitioning step, data dependence analysis step and priority scheduling step. The simulation results show that the proposed algorithm reduce the occurrence of peak power by up to around 11{\%} compared to the existing algorithms. {\textcopyright}2010 IEEE.},

abstract = {The potential of multi-core chips for high performance and reliability at low cost has made them ideal computing platforms for embedded real-time systems. As a result, power management of a multi-core chip has become an important issue in the design of embedded real-time systems. Most existing approaches have been designed to regulate the behavior of average power consumption, such as minimizing the total energy consumption or the chip temperature. However, little attention has been paid to the worst-case behavior of instantaneous power consumption on a chip, called chip-level peak power consumption , an important design parameter that determines the cost and/or size of chip design/packaging and the underlying power supply. We address this problem by reducing the chip-level peak power consumption at design time without violating any real-time constraints. We achieve this by carefully scheduling real-time tasks, without relying on any additional hardware implementation for power management, such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling. Specifically, we propose a new scheduling algorithm FP$\Theta$ that restricts the concurrent execution of tasks assigned on different cores, and perform its schedulability analysis. Using this analysis, we develop a method that finds a set of concurrent executable tasks, such that the design-time chip-level peak power consumption is minimized and all timing requirements are met. We demonstrate via simulation that the proposed method not only keeps the design-time chip-level peak power consumption as low as the theoretical lower bound for trivial cases, but also reduces the peak power consumption for non-trivial cases by up to {\$}12.9{\$} percent compared to the case of no restriction on concurrent task execution. {\textcopyright} 1990-2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {The number and diversity of cores in on-chip systems is increasing rapidly. However, due to the Thermal Design Power (TDP) constraint, it is not possible to continuously operate all cores at the same time. Exceeding the TDP constraint may activate the Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) to ensure thermal stability. Such hardware based closed-loop safeguards pose a big challenge in using many-core chips for real-time tasks. Managing the worst-case peak power usage of a chip can help toward resolving this issue. We present a scheme to minimize the peak power usage for frame-based and periodic real-time tasks on many-core processors by scheduling the sleep cycles for each active core and introduce the concept of a sufficient test for peak power consumption for task feasibility. We consider both inter-task and inter-core diversity in terms of power usage and present computationally efficient algorithms for peak power minimization for these cases, i.e., a special case of 'homogeneous tasks on homogeneous cores' to the general case of 'heterogeneous tasks on heterogeneous cores'. We evaluate our solution through extensive simulations using the 48-core SCC platform and gem5 architecture simulator. Our simulation results show the efficacy of our scheme.},

MCS, like all other electronic systems, are susceptible to transient faults. These systems must mitigate the effects of faults and provide recovery mechanisms when faults occur. In this paper, we consider the problem of designing and scheduling certifiable fault-tolerant mixed-criticality systems. To address certification and transient faults, two-mode models must treat any single overrun or fault as a combination of the two, reserving time for the re-execution of tasks with extended execution time. We therefore propose a new four-mode model that addresses fault and execution time overrun with separate modes. This model, combined with the selective continuation of low-criticality tasks, improves the quality of service (QoS) to these tasks while providing the same guarantee to high-criticality tasks. Experimental results show that QoS improvements of up to 42.9{\%} can be achieved by the new model. Furthermore, we show how the model and its schedulability analysis can be calibrated to realistic failures rates to achieve even more efficient designs.},

These authorities are interested in verifying the safety-critical aspects of a system and, typically, do not certify non-critical parts. The design of such Mixed-Criticality Systems (MCS) has received increasing attention in recent years. However, although MCS must be designed to overcome transient faults, their susceptibility to transient faults is often overlooked. In this paper, we consider the problem of mapping and scheduling efficient, certifiable MCS that can survive transient faults. We generalize previous MCS models and analysis to support On-Demand Redundancy (ODR). A task set transformation is proposed to generate a modified task set that supports various forms of ODR while satisfying reliability and certification requirements. The analysis is incorporated into a design space exploration algorithm that supports a wide range of fault-Tolerance mechanisms and heterogeneous platforms. Experiments show that ODR can improve Quality of Service (QoS) provided to non-critical tasks by 29 percent on average, compared to lockstep execution. Moreover, combining several fault-Tolerance mechanisms can lead to additional improvements in schedulability and QoS.},

abstract = {Adopting mixed-criticality architectures enable safe sharing of computational resources between tasks of different criticalities consequently leading to reduced Size, Weight and Power (SWaP) requirements. A majority of the research in mixed-criticality systems focuses on scheduling tasks whose Worst Case Execution Times (WCETs) are certified to varying levels of assurances. If any given task overruns its WCET, the system switches to a higher criticality and all the lower criticality tasks are discarded to make time for the execution of higher criticality tasks. Task execution time overruns are transient faults that are typically tolerated by simply executing an alternate task before the original deadline, or, by discarding the failed task to prevent it from interfering with higher criticality tasks. However, permanent faults such as processor failures can render the system to be useless, many times leading to unsafe states. In this paper we present a taxonomy of fault tolerance techniques to tolerate permanent faults, as well as map it to real-time mixed-criticality requirements based on the extend of fault coverage that in turn influences the associated assurance.},

On such systems, a real-time task may exhibit different WCETs (Worst Case Execution Times) in different criticality modes. It is well-known that traditional real-time scheduling methods are not applicable to ensure the timely requirement of the mixed-criticality tasks. In this paper, the authors study a problem of scheduling real-time, mixed-criticality tasks with fault tolerance. An optimal, off-line algorithm is designed to guarantee the most tasks completing successfully when the system runs into the high-criticality mode. A formal proof of the optimality is given. Also, a novel on-line slack-reclaiming algorithm is proposed to recover from computing faults before the tasks' deadline during the run-time. Simulations show that an improvement of about 30{\%} in performance is obtained by using the slack-reclaiming method.},

Mixed-criticality (MC) has been proposed to meet a trade-off between these two aspects. Nonetheless, most task models considered in the literature of MC scheduling, do not take into account precedence constraints among tasks. In this paper, we propose a multicore scheduling approach for a model presenting MC tasks and their dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We also introduce an evaluation framework for this model, released as an open source software. Evaluation of our scheduling algorithm provides evidence of the difficulty to find correct scheduling for DAGs of MC tasks. Besides, experimentation results provided in this paper show that our scheduling algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for scheduling DAGs of MC tasks.},

Fault tolerance is achieved through an adaptive checkpointing scheme that dynamically adjusts the checkpointing interval during task execution. Adaptive checkpointing is then combined with a dynamic voltage scaling scheme to achieve power reduction. The resulting energy-aware adaptive checkpointing scheme uses a dynamic voltage scaling criterion that is based not only on the slack in task execution but also on the occurrences of faults during task execution. Simulation results show that compared to previous methods, the proposed approach significantly reduces power consumption and increases the likelihood of timely task completion in the presence of faults. {\textcopyright} 2003 IEEE.},

abstract = {There are many applications in which the reliability of the overall system must be far higher than the reliability of its individual components. In such cases, designers devise mechanisms and architectures that allow the system to either completely mask the effects of a component failure or recover from it so quickly that the application is not seriously affected. This is the work of fault-tolerant designers and their work is increasingly important and complex not only because of the increasing number of mission critical applications, but also because the diminishing reliability of hardware means that even systems for non-critical applications will need to be designed with fault-tolerance in mind. Reflecting the real-world challenges faced by designers of these systems, this book addresses fault tolerance design with a systems approach to both hardware and software. No other text on the market takes this approach, nor offers the comprehensive and up-to-date treatment Koren and Krishna provide. Students, designers and architects of high performance processors will value this comprehensive overview of the field. * The first book on fault tolerance design with a systems approach * Comprehensive coverage of both hardware and software fault tolerance, as well as information and time redundancy * Incorporated case studies highlight six different computer systems with fault-tolerance techniques implemented in their design * Available to lecturers is a complete ancillary package including online solutions manual for instructors and PowerPoint slides.

abstract = {Modern safety critical real-time systems are composed of tasks of mixed criticalities and the problem of scheduling them in a fault tolerant manner, on a distributed platform, is challenging. Fault tolerance is typically achieved by using redundancy techniques, most commonly in the form of temporal redundancy which involves executing an alternate task before the original deadline of the failed task. Additionally, studies like Zonal Hazard Analysis (ZHA) and Fault Hazard Analysis (FHA) may impose extra constraints on the re-executions, e.g., spatial separation of alternates, to improve reliability. In this paper, we present a method for scheduling mixed criticality real-time tasks on a distributed platform in a fault tolerant manner while taking into account the recommendations given by the reliability studies like ZHA and FHA. First, we use mathematical optimization to allocate tasks on the processors, and then derive fault tolerant and fault aware feasibility windows for the critical and non-critical tasks respectively. Finally, we derive scheduler specific task attributes like priorities for the fixed priority scheduler. Our method provides hard real-time fault tolerance guarantees for critical tasks while maximizing resource utilization for non-critical tasks},

This paper considers scheduling sporadic tasks with three interrelated design constraints: (i) meeting the hard deadlines of application tasks, (ii) providing fault tolerance by executing backups, and (iii) respecting the criticality of each task to facilitate system's certification. First, a new approach to model mixed-criticality systems from the perspective of fault tolerance is proposed. Second, a uniprocessor fixed-priority scheduling algorithm, called fault-tolerant mixed-criticality (FTMC) scheduling, is designed for the proposed model. The FTMC algorithm executes backups to recover from task errors caused by hardware or software faults. Third, a sufficient schedulability test is derived, when satisfied for a (mixed-criticality) task set, guarantees that all deadlines are met even if backups are executed to recover from errors. Finally, evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed test.},

abstract = {Multicore platforms provide a great opportunity for implementation of fault-tolerance techniques to achieve high reliability in real-time embedded systems. Passive redundancy is well-suited for multicore platforms and a well-established technique to tolerate transient and permanent faults. However, it incurs significant power overheads, which go wasted in fault-free execution scenarios. Meanwhile, due to the Thermal Design Power (TDP) constraint, in some cases, it is not feasible to simultaneously power on all cores on a multicore platform. Since TDP is the maximum sustainable power that a chip can consume, violating TDP makes some cores automatically restart or significantly reduce their performance to prevent a permanent damage. This may affect timeliness of the system, and hence, designers face a challenge in deciding how to use multicore platforms in real-time embedded systems. In this paper, at first, we study how the use of passive redundancy (especially for Triple Modular redundancy) can violate TDP on multicore platforms. Then, we propose a scheme for scheduling real-time tasks in multicore systems to conquer the peak power problem in NMR systems. This is because in multicore embedded systems an efficient solution for meeting the TDP constraint is reducing the peak power consumption. The proposed scheme tries to remove overlaps of the peak power of concurrently executing tasks to keep the maximum power consumption below the chip TDP. In the proposed scheme, we devised a policy called PPA-LTF to manage peak power consumption. This policy prevents tasks execution that consume higher power according to the tasks' power traces. Our experimental results show that our scheme provides up to 50 percent (on average by 39 percent) peak power reduction compared to state-of-the-art schemes.},

For dual-criticality systems (DCS), dual-rate fluid-based scheduling has been widely studied, e.g., the state-of-the-art approaches mixed-criticality fluid scheduling (MCF) and MC-Sort. However, most of the existing works on DCS either only focus on the schedulability analysis or minimize the energy consumption treating leakage power as a constant. To this end, this paper considers the effect of temperature on leakage power and proposes a thermal and power aware fluid scheduling strategy, referred to as thermal and energy aware (TA)-MCF which minimizes both the energy consumption and temperature, while ensuring a comparable schedulability ratio compared with the MCF and MC-Sort. Extensive experiments validate the efficiency of TA-MCF.},

Increasing power densities have led to the dark silicon era, for which heterogeneous multicores with different power and performance characteristics are promising architectures. This paper focuses on maximizing the overall system performance under a critical temperature constraint for heterogeneous tiled multicores, where all cores or accelerators inside a tile share the same voltage and frequency levels. For such architectures, we present a resource management technique that introduces power density as a novel system level constraint, in order to avoid thermal violations. The proposed technique then assigns applications to tiles by choosing their degree of parallelism and the voltage/frequency levels of each tile, such that the power density constraint is satisfied. Moreover, our technique provides runtime adaptation of the power density constraint according to the characteristics of the executed applications, and reacting to workload changes at runtime. Thus, the available thermal headroom is exploited to maximize the overall system performance.},

The resulting energy-aware adaptive checkpointing scheme uses a dynamic voltage scaling criterion that is based not only on the slack in task execution but also on the occurrences of faults during task execution.

Moreover, the rate of transient faults (i.e., soft errors caused, for example, by cosmic ray radiations) also depends on system operating frequency and supply voltage. Thus, there is an interesting trade-off between system reliability and energy consumption. This paper first investigates the effects of frequency and voltage scaling on the fault rate and proposes two fault rate models based on previously published data. Then, the effects of energy management on reliability is studied. Our analysis results show that, energy management through frequency and voltage scaling could dramatically reduce system reliability, and ignoring the effects of energy management on the fault rate is too optimistic and may lead to unsatisfied system reliability. {\textcopyright} 2004 IEEE.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. Deploying safety-critical systems into constrained embedded platforms is a challenge for developers who must arbitrate between two conflicting objectives: software has to be safe and resources need to be used efficiently. Mixed-criticality (MC) has been proposed to meet a trade-off between these two aspects. Nonetheless, most task models considered in the literature of MC scheduling, do not take into account precedence constraints among tasks. In this paper, we propose a multicore scheduling approach for a model presenting MC tasks and their dependencies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). We also introduce an evaluation framework for this model, released as an open source software. Evaluation of our scheduling algorithm provides evidence of the difficulty to find correct scheduling for DAGs of MC tasks. Besides, experimentation results provided in this paper show that our scheduling algorithm outperforms existing algorithms for scheduling DAGs of MC tasks.},

In this work, we propose schemes that explore dynamic slack for energy savings while taking system reliability into consideration. The proposed schemes dynamically schedule an additional recovery to recuperate the reliability loss due to energy management. Based on the amount of available slack, the application size and the fault rate changes, we analyze when it is profitable to reclaim the slack for energy savings without sacrificing system reliability. Checkpoint technique is further explored to efficiently use the slack. Analytical and simulation results show that, the proposed reliability-aware energy management schemes can achieve comparable energy savings as ordinary energy management schemes while preserving system reliability. The ordinary energy management schemes that ignore the effects of voltage scaling on fault rate changes could lead to drastically decreased system reliability.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an N-modular redundancy (NMR) technique with low energy-overhead for hard real-time multi-core systems. NMR is well-suited for multi-core platforms as they provide multiple processing units and low-overhead communication for voting. However, it can impose considerable energy overhead and hence its energy overhead must be controlled, which is the primary consideration of this paper. For this purpose the system operation can be divided into two phases: indispensable phase and on-demand phase. In the indispensable phase only half-plus-one copies for each task are executed. When no fault occurs during this phase, the results must be identical and hence the remaining copies are not required. Otherwise, the remaining copies must be executed in the on-demand phase to perform a complete majority voting. In this paper, for such a two-phase NMR, an energy-management technique is developed where two new concepts have been considered: i) Block-partitioned scheduling that enables parallel task execution during on-demand phase, thereby leaving more slack for energy saving, ii) Pseudo-dynamic slack, that results when a task has no faulty execution during the indispensable phase and hence the time which is reserved for its copies in the on-demand phase is reclaimed for energy saving. The energy-management technique has an off-line part that manages static and pseudo-dynamic slacks at design time and an online part that mainly manages dynamic slacks at run-time. Experimental results show that the proposed NMR technique provides up to 29 percent energy saving and is 6 orders of magnitude higher reliable as compared to a recent previous work.},

abstract = {The negative effects of the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) technique on the system reliability has recently promoted the research on reliability-aware power management (RAPM). RAPM aims at reducing the system energy consumption while preserving the system's reliability. In this paper, we study the RAPM problem for parallel realtime applications for shared memory multiprocessor systems in the presence of precedence constraints. We show that this problem is NP-hard. Depending on how recoveries are scheduled and utilized by a subset of selected tasks, we investigate both individual-recovery and shared-recovery based RAPM heuristics. Online RAPM schemes that exploit dynamic slack generated at runtime are also considered. The proposed schemes are evaluated through extensive simulations. The results show that all schemes can preserve system reliability under all settings. For modest system loads, similar energy savings are obtained by all static schemes. However, when the system load is low, the shared-recovery based schemes need coordinated recovery operations on all processors and thus save less energy.

abstract = {The Elastic Mixed-Criticality (E-MC) task model and an Early-Release EDF (ER-EDF) scheduling algorithm have been studied to address the service interruption problem for low- criticality tasks in uniprocessor systems, where the minimum ser- vice requirements of low-criticality tasks are guaranteed by their maximum periods. In this paper, focusing on multicore systems, we first investigate and empirically evaluate the schedulability of E-MC tasks under partitioned-EDF (P-EDF) by considering various task-to-core mapping heuristics. Then, to improve the service levels of low-criticality tasks by exploiting slack at runtime, with and without task migrations being considered, we study both global and local early-release schemes. Moreover, considering varied migration overheads between different cores, we propose the multicore-aware and migration constrained global- ER schemes. The simulation results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art Global EDF-VD scheduler, P-EDF with various partitioning heuristics can lead to many more schedulable E-MC task sets. Moreover, our proposed global and local ER schemes can significantly improve the execution frequencies (and thus service levels) of low-criticality tasks, while Global EDF-VD may severely affect them by discarding most of their task instances at runtime (especially for systems with more cores). Furthermore, by allowing task migrations, global-ER schemes can dramatically improve low-criticality tasks' service levels for partitionings that do},

@article{Munir2012,
abstract = {With Moore's law supplying billions of transistors on-chip, embedded systems are undergoing a transition from single-core to multicore to exploit this high-transistor density for high performance. Embedded systems differ from traditional high-performance supercomputers in that power is a first-order constraint for embedded systems; whereas, performance is the major benchmark for supercomputers. The increase in on-chip transistor density exacerbates power/thermal issues in embedded systems, which necessitates novel hardware/software power/thermal management techniques to meet the ever-increasing high-performance embedded computing demands in an energy-efficient manner. This paper outlines typical requirements of embedded applications and discusses state-of-the-art hardware/software high-performance energy-efficient embedded computing (HPEEC) techniques that help meeting these requirements. We also discuss modern multicore processors that leverage these HPEEC techniques to deliver high performance per watt. Finally, we present design challenges and future research directions for HPEEC system development. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Lee2012,
abstract = {For lightly loaded multicore processors that contain more processing cores than running tasks and have dynamic voltage and frequency scaling capability, we address the energy-efficient scheduling of periodic real-time tasks. First, we introduce two energy-saving techniques for the lightly loaded multicore processors: exploiting overabundant cores for executing a task in parallel with a lower frequency and turning off power of rarely used cores. Next, we verify that if the two introduced techniques are supported, then the problem of minimizing energy consumption of real-time tasks while meeting their deadlines is NP-hard on a lightly loaded multicore processor. Finally, we propose a polynomial-time scheduling scheme that provides a near minimum-energy feasible schedule. The difference of energy consumption between the provided schedule and the minimum-energy schedule is limited. The scheme saves up to 64 percent of the processing core energy consumed by the previous scheme that executes each task on a separate core.},

@inproceedings{Henkel2013,
abstract = {As embedded on-chip systems grow more and more complex and are about to be deployed in automotive and other demanding application areas (beyond the main-stream of consumer electronics), run-time adaptation is a prime design consideration for many reasons: i) reliability is a major concern when migrating to technology nodes of 32nm and beyond, ii) efficiency i.e. computational power per Watt etc. is a challenge as computing models do not keep up with hardware-provided computing capabilities, iii) power densities increase rapidly as Dennard Scaling fails resulting in what is dubbed "Dark Silicon", iv) highly complex embedded applications are hard to predict etc. All these scenarios (and further not listed here) make proactive and sophisticated run-time adaption techniques a prime design consideration for generations of multi-core architectures to come. The intend of this paper is to present problems and solutions of top research initiatives from diverse angels with the common denominator of the dire need for run-time adaption: The first part tackles the thermal problem i.e. high power densities and the related short and long-term effects it has on the reliability and it presents scalable techniques to cope the related problems. The second section demonstrates the potential of steep slope devices on thread scheduling of multi-cores. The third approach presents embedded pipelined architectures running complex multi-media applications whereas the fourth section introduces the paradigm of invasive computing i.e. a novel computing approach promising high efficiency through a highly-adaptive hardware/software architecture. In summary, the paper presents snapshots on four highlyadaptive solutions and platforms from different angles for challenges of complex future multi-core systems. {\&}copy; 2013 IEEE.},
